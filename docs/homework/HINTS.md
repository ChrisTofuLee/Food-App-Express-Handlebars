# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. This app will be a test of everything we've done so far, it's going to test from the database all the way through the api and into the frontend. Nothing will be left untouched.

1. You're given an entire walkthrough from start to finish for what you need to do in order to get this app working. The instructions are there to keep you on the right path and avoid any rabbit holes!

1. Using MySQL in the cli to source some of the data, while we haven't done this - it's as easy as it looks in the instructions!

1. Some of the code is going to be complex, and it looks like marks are attributed to good comments in this because theere's a lot going on.

1. Heroku WILL ask for a credit card, but you WILL NOT be charged.

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Handlebars must be used for your template engine, no sneaking standard html through

1. Your structure in your folders and files HAS to represent what was given in the instructions at minnimum

1. You should be able to add and delete burgers. Any changes to the burgers MUST reflect on the database. (Not localStorage)

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo and it should be deployed on Heroku, _including the database_!

   > Check for sneaky console errors and leftover console logs!

1. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

1. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots

1. **THIS HAS TO HAVE A LINK ON YOUR PORTFOLIO WEBSITE!**

1. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

1. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
